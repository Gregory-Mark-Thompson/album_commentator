<h1>Overview of the App, Album Commentator</h1>

This app fetches album art & a little bit of album information from Discogs. It allows users to comment on these albums, and users and guests can both see albums
& search for them and see all comments on them. Users can also like comments that they didn't make. Searches can be done by genre & "style" or sub-genre.

<h1>Future Plans for Album Commentator</h1>

I plan to add more search categories, such as the ability to search by Artist/Album Name, Album Year, and possibly the ability to do an "Or" multi-field search.
I also plan to give users the ability to pull up more than 50 results, and also I want to make it so all results will load just on further pages.
